This workshop, part of the 2024 University of Idaho _Information Landscapes_ series, will teach attendees how to identify archival images without location metadata using text analysis, reverse image search, landmark identification, and aerial time-lapse tools. The intention of this work is to introduce freely accessible tools and methods to researchers new to the discipline, providing a foundational understanding rather than comprehensive proficiency.

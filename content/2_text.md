**A simple place to start** is to use the text that is provided to you, both in the photograph and on the physical album. Even if only one in two hundred photos is labeled, that small amount of information is enough to begin making connections. Using text within photographs, such as building names, signs and advertisements you can try searching these terms (using Boolean quotes for exact phrases) in Google, but you’ll usually find that the algorithm is much better suited for shopping than historical research. Instead, try using the [Newsbank newspaper resource](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/find/newspapers.html), plugging in the text and adding time and location parameters to refine results.

The examples I will be using for this presentation are from a scrapbook in our Special Collections titled [Unidentified Family Album, 1920-1939](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv928424) which I will use to illustrate the strengths and limitations of digital geolocation tools. Let's go through a few methods for identifying locations through text elements:

## First Example

{% include gallery-figure.html img="geo_06.jpg" width="100%" alt="Street scene of a parade with a float of a boat in a downtown area with a crowd standing on the sidewalk and a sign for Raymond Cafe near awnings." caption="Photograph PG070-18-02 from Unidentified Family Album and detail, 1920-1939, Courtesy U of I Special Collections" %}

Searching for the Raymond Cafe, and refining by adding “Idaho” we find that this photo was taken on the Main Street of Lewiston and that the owner of the cafe was a leading figure of [Idaho Chinese American history](https://infoweb-newsbank-com.uidaho.idm.oclc.org/apps/news/document-view?p=AMNEWS&docref=news/156BF6F9304573D0&f=basic). Looking at the float next to the building, we can also determine that the photo was taken during the now defunct [Rose Parade](https://infoweb-newsbank-com.uidaho.idm.oclc.org/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=29250C9388694CD885C6DCB22A43B157&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Aimage%252Fv2%253A114CF38DF1A90B10%2540EANX-1196094F5699C058%25402420298-1196095018949658%254023-1196095416EB10C0%2540Society/hlterms%3A%2522lewiston%2522%2520%2522rose%2520parade%2522%2520), which was annually held in the middle of June.

## Second Example

{% include gallery-figure.html img="geo_10.jpg" width="100%" alt="Overhead view of a small city with mountains in the background." caption="Photograph PG070-66-01 from Unidentified Family Album and detail, 1920-1939, Courtesy U of I Special Collections" %}

While there are actually a few structures here that are identifiable through reverse image searching, we can also identify this location with text. Zooming in on this little storefront, we can make out the business name **“Butterfield-Elder Implement Company,”** which brings up the article [Federal Buildings of North Idaho](https://infoweb-newsbank-com.uidaho.idm.oclc.org/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=29250C9388694CD885C6DCB22A43B157&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Aimage%252Fv2%253A114CF38DF1A90B10%2540EANX-118B902C32A7E928%25402417431-118B902C40943180%25400-118B902CA0244198%2540Federal%252BBuildings%252Bin%252BNorth%252BIdaho.%252BBids%252BOpened%252Bfor%252BSites%252Bin%252BLewiston%252Band%252BMoscow/hlterms%3A) where this is listed as a business located in Moscow. Because of the specificity of the name and the location being generally in the same area as other photos in the collection, we can be fairly sure this is an overhead shot of Moscow.

## Third Example

{% include gallery-figure.html img="geo_13.jpg" width="100%" alt="Shipping vessel docked in nondescript area." caption="Photograph PG070-14-01 from Unidentified Family Album and detail, 1920-1939, Courtesy U of I Special Collections" %}

Searching for the Kaga Maru steamship (one word on the ship but two in newspapers) we find this Japanese - American line stopped at many points along China, Japan and Southeast Asia but [connected only to Seattle](https://infoweb-newsbank-com.uidaho.idm.oclc.org/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=29250C9388694CD885C6DCB22A43B157&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Aimage%252Fv2%253A11A73E5827618330%2540EANX-12383880D91EE880%25402415590-1231FC62D3710918%254010-12D9CD597396AA40%2540Advertisement/hlterms%3A)

## Fourth Example

{% include gallery-figure.html img="geo_16.jpg" width="100%" alt="Shipping vessel docked in nondescript area." caption="Photograph PG070-14-01 from Unidentified Family Album and detail, 1920-1939, Courtesy U of I Special Collections" %}

Finally, **the most easily identifiable of the bunch** is certainly the [Giant Geyser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Geyser) of Yosemite National Park in Wyoming, but this does help establish the larger parameters of area that the scrapbook is likely to be within: From a base in Moscow, southeast to Yellowstone and northwest to Seattle.

{% include card.html text="Getting these relatively simple and definitive items out of the way helps reduce the size of our potential map as we move forward to the next geolocation method." %}

**Hello, my name is Andrew Weymouth** and I have worked with the University of Idaho Library as the [Digital Initiatives Librarian](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/aweymouth.html) in the [Center for Digital Inquiry](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) and Learning (CDIL) department since the fall of 2023. My work generally consists of creating and maintaining our digital collections, working with CDIL fellows, helping to rethink processes and introducing new digital scholarship tools to the department

## Why Geolocate?

**To begin**, I would like to provide an example of how geolocation tools can help enrich your research. In the summer of 2023, I was working on an article about Filipino American “Alaskeros” who traveled between California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska to work seasonally in the salmon canneries.

**One of the only first person resources** I was able to find from this community of migratory workers was a scrapbook of an Alaskero from the 1930s from the Filipino American National Historical Society in Seattle, Washington. The photographs of Salvador Caballero provided an incredibly candid perspective of migratory life between San Francisco and Kodiak Island off of the coast of Alaska and a unique insight into an industry whose physical spaces are frequently erased.

**Though the platform has been in development for almost 20 years**, continued improvements in satellite imagery and recent advancements in 3D technology have made even this remote area of Alaska identifiable through [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/). Because I was able to glean the name of the cannery from one of the few notes written in the scrapbook by Caballero (“Karluk Cannery” named after the river that runs through the island), I was able to do one of the simplest types of geolocation: simply tracing the coastline within Google Earth until I could match natural landforms. If you are lucky enough to work on a geolocation project on an island or a similarly contained area, this is relatively simple work, as the natural rock formations of a coastline are unlikely to change too drastically in 100 years.

**By being able to connect landforms between photographs and satellite imagery**, an entirely new layer of historical context can be drawn from a photo album. A researcher can understand how much free time workers had by how far they were able to travel for recreation. You can get a better understanding of race and class dynamics through the placement of housing structures and the company’s distance from the island’s indigenous community. This presentation has been created to give you a better understanding of the tools and methodologies of geolocation to similarly enrich your own research and make new academic discoveries.

**Just as "chronolocation" is the process of determining when a picture was taken**, geolocation is the process of determining where a visual resource was taken, whether it is a static or moving image. The following sections have been organized as a kind of workflow: moving from the most straight-forward to more complicated approaches.

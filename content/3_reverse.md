**Like Google Earth satellite imaging**, the basic functionality of reverse image searching has been in development for many years but relatively recent innovations have made it more accurate than ever. The way that it works is an algorithm is developed to analyze the content of an image and reduce it down to a unique digital signature or “fingerprint.” Then the algorithm looks for similar fingerprints across the rest of that platform’s database. The first publicly available reverse image search engine named Tineye was launched in 2008, followed by Russia based platform Yandex, then Google and Bing.

**For an exact image match*, for instance when verifying copyright of an image without metadata, I recommend using [TinEye](https://tineye.com/). When you need to identify an area that may be taken from a slightly different angle, lighting or proximity, as is almost always the case with geolocation, I would recommend using [Google Lens](https://lens.google/) or [Bing Visual Search](https://www4.bing.com/visualsearch). These algorithms excel because they are able to detect particular digital signatures that align with your image from an otherwise contrasting image, such as one distinctive structure or the  particular shape of a skyline. While [Yandex](https://yandex.com/images/) is [by some accounts the most accurate of all of these tools for geolocation](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/08/09/using-new-tech-to-investigate-old-photographs/), I’ve found that search results skew heavily towards locations in Russia and Europe.

## Strengths

* **Dramatically distinct patterns in the landscape**, as in this [Swallows Nest Rock](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/postcards/items/nwpostcards736.html) on Snake River located in Clarkston, Washington.

Many of these roadside attraction type images are readily identifiable simply because the lookout areas often mean that people have been taking the same photos of the same things from the same perspective for 100 plus years, so there are plenty of digital fingerprints in any given database to reference!

* **Distinct patterns in the built environment are also effective.**

The same image we located through text analysis is also identifiable through reverse image searching. Although we don’t have an explanation of what the Google Lens algorithm matched between this photo (PG070-66-01) and [this one](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/cities/items/cities87.html), taken from a significantly different angle, it would be surprising if it wasn’t the distinctively shaped little white building on the bottom left of both images with its heavily contrasted doors and windows creating a *unique digital fingerprint*.

The pattern of the bridge and geological markings helped identify the now demolished [Spalding Bridge](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/laughlin/items/spec_kl1209.html) on the Clearwater River east of Lewiston (PG070-18-01) and the festivities indicate this may have taken place during the opening ceremony of the structure in 1923.

## Weaknesses

* Popular text against nondescript surroundings

{% include gallery-figure.html img="geo_26.jpg" width="75%" alt="A boat in stilts, partially covered by a shed that has the words National Geographic painted on the side" caption="Photograph PG070-18-01 from Unidentified Family Album, 1920-1939, Courtesy U of I Special Collections." %}

There were hundreds of unrelated National Geographic results that were generated for this image, but none having to do with this strange piece of roadside architecture.

* Residential architecture

{% include gallery-figure.html img="geo_27.jpg" width="75%" alt="A craftsman style house on a street corner with a woman sitting on the steps" caption="Photograph PG070-16-03 from Unidentified Family Album, 1920-1939, Courtesy U of I Special Collections." %}

These types of houses were literally sold in catalogs, making these digital fingerprints too pervasive to identify with reverse image searching.

* Sparsely populated areas

{% include gallery-figure.html img="geo_28.jpg" width="75%" alt="An agricultural landscape with two houses and orchard trees present" caption="Photograph PG070-23-01 from Unidentified Family Album, 1920-1939, Courtesy U of I Special Collections." %}

The lack of distinctive digital signatures, and the higher likelihood that the area has never been photographed and would not be within the reverse image searching platform’s database makes the success rate on these types of images much lower.

* Pervasive industrial structures

{% include gallery-figure.html img="geo_29.jpg" width="75%" alt="A long agricultural packaging structure with a grain elevator in the background" caption="Photograph PG070-23-01 from Unidentified Family Album, 1920-1939, Courtesy U of I Special Collections." %}

Similar to residential architecture, these reverse imaging tools also have difficulty commonplace industrial structures, which often lack unique fingerprints in contrast and are so large they often obscure helpful context in the skyline.

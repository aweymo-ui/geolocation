**All of the tools and methods that we covered in this workshop** can, of course, be applied to studies outside of the archive. Locating visual resources is just a use case. 

These methods can be used to track wildlife migration patters in environmental sciences, analyze spatial data in infrastructure development, optimize delivery routes in transportation and logistical work, analyze spatial relationships between artifacts in archaeology or, in the case of the Overpass Turbo map we looked at earlier, quickly identify the nearest junk food.

Thank you for your time.

**All of the tools and methods that we covered in this workshop** can, of course, be applied to studies outside of the archive. Locating visual resources is just a use case. These geolocation tactics can also be used to refine and enhance your scientific, historical or archeological research, or, in the case of the Overpass Turbo map we looked at earlier, quickly identify the nearest junk food.

Thank you for your time.

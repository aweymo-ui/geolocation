"The oral history project explores both the social and ecological dimensions of Taylor Wilderness Research Station through recorded interviews with past and present researchers, teachers, station managers, and students" with "interviews focused on uncovering often-ignored social and experiential content behind scientific pursuit, offering a narrative index of social-ecological change within a wilderness environment."
